Arduino shield with various DCC Cab Bus and control interfaces

UPDATE 

I ordered 10x boards from SeeedStudio
I also placed a Mouser order for all the parts except for the LM317LD, which nobody has in stock and the 'duino headers, which I order from SAMTEK
The board cost $4, the parts come to $30 + shipping.

UPDATE

The boards came in and I've built up one for testing - the LEDs and Loconet parts work, and I'm trying to understand the openLCB code...
