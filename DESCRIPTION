Arduino shield with various DCC Cab Bus and control interfaces

UPDATE

More prototyping and experimentation

Made a small production run

Nit:  The diodes I used in this version are too small to see the polarity banding, which makes assembly difficult!

The first batch is out in the hands of OpenLCB developers, and seems to be working well - except for the overloading of D10 by the CAN SPI code, one of the buttons and the ethernet SPI shield...  Sigh.
